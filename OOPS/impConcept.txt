 4- pillars of OOPS:
 (1)--> Encapsulation: wrapping up of data(properties) and methods(funtion).Also
                       it implements data hiding.
                       eg: class{
                        properties + methods
                       }
 (2)--> Inheritance: properties and methods are passed from 
                     paresnt class to derieved class      

                    ****These are of 4 types****                 
                    (i)  --> Single level Inheritance {BAse class to Derieved class}
                    (ii) --> Multi level Inheritance {Base -> derieved->derieved} Animal ->Mamal->Dog
                    (iii)--> Hierarchial Inheritance {base->other derieved classes} 
                    (iv) --> Hybrid Inheritance {mix of all above}
 (3)--> Polymorphism: one thing that behaves in many ways     
 (4)--> Abstraction: hide all unnecessary data and shows the user only the important data
